## Overview

This repository contains a complete project management plan developed as part of CN6004 coursework, proposing a solution to Transport for London's (TfL) cybersecurity challenges following a data breach affecting 5,000+ Oyster card users.

**Project Context:** In 2024, TfL experienced a cyber security incident compromising customer data including names, contact details, and banking information. This project proposes a secure, redesigned mobile app to restore customer trust and improve the Student Oyster Card experience.

## Project Objectives (SMART)

- **Specific:** Create a secure, user-friendly app with robust firewalls to protect customer data
- **Measurable:** Achieve 95% user satisfaction and boost app security by 80%
- **Achievable:** Redesign app with professional developers for secure experience
- **Relevant:** Improve student Oyster card experience with easy applications, payments, and tracking
- **Time-bound:** Launch within 12 months; reduce cyber-attack incidents within 6 months

## Key Features Proposed

- Secure card applications directly through the app
- Travel card and bus pass purchases
- Real-time transaction access
- Comprehensive travel history tracking
- GDPR-compliant data protection
- Accessibility features (screen-reader support, customizable text)
- Offline access to prevent digital exclusion

## Project Management Methodologies Applied

### 1. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
Comprehensive decomposition of project deliverables into manageable components.

### 2. Resource Planning
Detailed allocation of human, technical, and financial resources across project phases.

### 3. Project Network Planning
Critical path analysis and timeline visualization for 12-month development cycle.

### 4. Cost Estimation (3 Methodologies)

#### Top-Down Cost Estimation
High-level budget allocation based on similar projects and expert judgment.

#### Bottom-Up Cost Estimation
Detailed cost analysis built from individual work packages and resources.

#### Delphi Method
Iterative expert consensus approach:
- **Round 1:** Initial expert estimates and feedback collection
- **Round 2:** Refined questionnaire based on Round 1 feedback
- **Result:** Convergent cost estimate of £209K-£355K

### 5. Feasibility Analysis

**Technical Feasibility:** ✅ Proven technologies available  
**Economic Feasibility:** ✅ ROI positive within 18 months  
**Operational Feasibility:** ✅ User acceptance and adoption likely  
**Legal Feasibility:** ✅ GDPR compliance integrated

### 6. Impact Assessment

**Environmental Impact:**
- Minimizes paper waste through digital cards and e-receipts
- Energy-efficient design with minimal device resource usage
- Promotes sustainable travel behavior

**Ethical Impact:**
- Data privacy and security (GDPR compliance)
- Accessibility and inclusion for all users
- Avoids discrimination through offline access
- Transparent data usage policies
